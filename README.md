How can we determine which of the shopping transactions made using credit and debit cards are transactions made by real owners and which are fraudulent transactions made by fraudsters?

Perhaps at the moment, this fraud prevention system saves consumers millions of dollars a year.

The IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) and its partner Vesta Corporation are working on a number of different studies to ensure the smooth execution of transactions with higher accuracy fraud detection.

In this competition, we will try to predict fraudulent transactions to the machine with high accuracy by developing machine learning models using Vesta's real-world e-commerce data.
